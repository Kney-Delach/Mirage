## About
Mirage is a 2D spatial reasoning platformer I designed and developed with the aims of demonstrating a single core dynamic through fluid tutorialisation.

<a name="spatial-reasoning"></a>
## Spatial Reasoning
Games which revolve around spatial reasoning as their core dyhnamic are those which require
the player to think ahead of time, and determine possible results of an 
in-game puzzle, by analysing what the possible moves are, and figuring out what needs to be done to complete the puzzle.

Mirage demonstrates this requirement through its unique **player mirroring** mechanic.
